## Core Features (Must Have)

These implement the 5 core PRD features:

- ✅ **Add New Task**
  - User can create a new task with a title
  - Task has a creation timestamp
  - Empty titles are not allowed (basic validation)

- ✅ **View All Tasks**
  - Display all tasks in a list format
  - Show task title, creation date, and completion status
  - Tasks are initially fetched from mock backend data (`assets/mock_tasks.json`)

- ✅ **Mark Task as Complete/Incomplete**
  - User can toggle the completion status of a task
  - Clear visual distinction between completed and pending tasks (strikethrough + subdued style)

- ✅ **Delete Task**
  - User can remove a task from the list
  - Confirmation prompt before deletion

- ✅ **Filter Tasks**
  - Filter tasks by status: **All | Completed | Pending**
  - Active filter is visually indicated via segmented control

## Extra Features

On top of the core PRD, the app also includes:

- ✨ **Inline edit** task titles (click title → edit, Enter to save, Esc / click outside to cancel)
- ✨ **Undo delete** via snackbar (“Task deleted” + Undo)
- ✨ **Search** box that combines with the current filter
- ✨ **Smart ordering**: Pending first, Completed last; newest first within each group
- ✨ **Bulk actions**: “Mark all complete” and “Clear completed” (with confirmation)
- ✨ **Task counts + progress**: `X pending • Y completed` + thin completion bar
